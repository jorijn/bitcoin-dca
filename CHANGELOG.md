```shell
$ touch /location/to/bitcoin-dca/orders.csv # create the file if it does not exists yet
$ docker run <--usual-argments> -v /location/to/bitcoin-dca/orders.csv:/location/to/bitcoin-dca/orders.csv -e EXPORT_CSV=/location/to/bitcoin-dca/orders.csv buy 25 ... # example 
```

## [v1.2.0] - 2020-12-08
### Warning
Due to regulatory changes in The Netherlands, BL3P and Bitvavo currently require you to provide proof of address ownership, thus temporarily breaking Bitcoin-DCA's XPUB feature.

* Added lines to the project README.md to allow project funding through on-chain and lightning transactions

### Fixed
* Fixed a path in persistent storage documentation
* Fixed the DI container name, it was still called after the first launching exchange BL3P

### Changed
* Refactored the code to have one single point of truth for Bitcoin related facts like amount of satoshis and amount of decimals

### Removed
* Removed the beta warnings, the software has been in use for at least half a year now

## [v1.1.0] - 2020-07-05
### Added
* A Python based fallback mechanism for 32bits systems. Unfortunately a bug prevented Raspberry Pi users from using Xpubs properly. The system will automatically use the native, more advanced method or derivation for systems that are capable and degrade to the Python tool without people noticing.
